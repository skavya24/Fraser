  <h1>Scenario 5 </h1>
  <p>The user wants to upload a picture of the item they’re selling. How does this work, starting from their hard drive
    and then being sent to the application’s server?</p>
  <ol>
    <!-- All the major hardware components that were used in this scenario are bolded -->
    <li>The <b>hard drive</b> stores the data files through spinning platters, which are made up of magnetic material
      that allows the computer to read, erase and write data. The files contain information including the color pixels
      of the picture as well as codes for characters of text files.</li>
    <img src="images/hardDrive1.jpg" width=400 alt="Hard Drive Disk">
    <li> The heads of the hard drive read the data that is spread out on the magnetic layer of the disk platter. The
      platter is divided into billions of tiny areas or units of space that are independently magnetized (1) or
      demagnetized (0) to store binary code. The use of magnetism in computer storage is important as it continues
      storing that information after the power is switched off. The hard drive also has another important aspect to it
      called the cache buffer which increases the speed and efficiency of data between the drive and the computer. The
      cache holds frequently used data so it is not needed to get the information from the magnetic disk every time.
    </li>
    <li>Before the hard drive can transfer the data to the computer device, the computer has to startup. Once a computer
      is connected to a power source, like an outlet, the <b>power supply unit</b> (<i>PSU</i>) provides the power to
      the entirety of the computer. It takes the <abbr title="Alternating Current">AC</abbr> from the wall outlet or
      another power source to convert it into low-voltage regulated <abbr title="Direct Current">DC</abbr> power for the
      internal components.</li>
    <li>The PSU has a transformer, which changes the input voltage to the necessary outgoing voltage.</li>
    <li>Then the rectifier converts the incoming power from AC to DC.</li>
    <li>The filter relatively evens out the DC waves when it is converted. </li>
    <li>Lastly, the regulator in the PSU completely smoothes out any ripples left by the filter and prevents any voltage
      surges or drops.</li>
    <li>When the computer is starting up and the PSU starts to supply the PC the power it needs to function properly,
      the <b><abbr title="Read Only Memory">ROM</abbr></b> opens up the computer’s <abbr
        title="Basic Input/Output System">BIOS</abbr> and firmware that start up the computer. It is a type of
      non-volatile memory from which the user can only read and not write/make any changes to it. It is located on the
      <b>motherboard</b> and is part of the BIOS chip. It also stores information and operates fundamental things, like
      the screen & keyboard systems.</li>
    <li>ROM chips are made up of grids of OR gates using diodes. The ROM uses address input to select a memory location
      in the chip that contains the wanted content. </li>
    <li>Then the diodes will take the decoder’s output as its input to produce its own output, which starts the computer
      and other software.</li>
    <li>Once the computer is booted up, the computer has to pull up the image from the hard drive. The Northbridge of
      the motherboard communicates with and connects the hard drive and video card directly through the circuit using
      data buses or through cables. The motherboard is the primary piece of the computer, as it is the circuit board
      that connects all the computer’s components for them to be able to interact with each other, including the CPU and
      memory. </li>
    <ul>
      <li>There are two areas in the motherboard that are needed for information travel: the northbridge and
        southbridge. The Northbridge manages, connects, and communicates with the <abbr
          title="Control Processing Unit">CPU</abbr>, <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr> and various video
        processors. The front side bus in the motherboard the Southbridge allows for communication with other devices.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>To open and display the image, the <b>graphics card</b> is used. A graphics card uses 4 main components: a
      motherboard, a GPU, <abbr title="Video RAM">VRAM</abbr>, and a monitor or other output interfaces. The graphics
      processor unit (<i>GPU</i>) performs complicated mathematical and geometric calculations needed to the produce the
      graphics, which uses an enormous amount of transistors—sometimes even more than the typical CPU. It is located
      under a heat sink which increases heat flow away from the device through a series of fins.</li>
    <li>The VRAM of the graphics card is both read from and writen to simultaneously as it is dual ported, making it
      operate at high speeds. It is used by the GPU to store information about each pixel, its color, and its placement
      on the screen as it forms images.</li>
    <li>Then the RAMDAC (<i>random access memory digital-to-analog converter</i>), a microchip, converts digital image
      data into analog data that the computer can use to display the image. It also stores the color palette that is
      needed to generate the image. A cable is then used to transmit the data to the monitor. </li>
    <li>A cable is then used to transmit the data to the monitor from where the user uses software and the web to send a
      request to upload to the application’s server.</li>
    <li>The <b>RAM</b> stores data access that needs to be instantly accessed, which includes the opening of
      applications, internet browsing, and more. It is volatile, meaning the memory erases without power. The higher the
      speed the RAM has, the better the performance.</li>
    <li> It allows for the PC/application that opens the image to input its core files upon startup. The RAM is made up
      of electrical capacitors, which store the binary code using transistors to charge or discharge the capacitor.
    </li>
    <li>Data is retrieved from the RAM by the <b>CPU</b> chip. The purpose of a Central Processing Unit is to process
      data, from performing calculations to sending instructions to other computer components, it does various basic
      computer functions.</li>
    <li>The CPU receives electrical pulses from a timing circuit known as a clock, which regulates CPU activity. The
      clock can run at rates between hundreds of thousands and billions of cycles per second, depending on the
      processor.</li>
    <li>Then the <abbr title="Arithmetic Logic Unit">ALU</abbr> performs bitwise and mathematical operations that the
      control unit tells it to do. The chip starts to move and process the data via the motherboard in the proper
      sequence to its next intended location. The control unit also coordinates other activities in the CPU. It breaks
      down the received instructions into sets of actions for subsystems in the CPU to carry out. The CPU has a memory
      management unit, which has a quick but limited amount of memory. It has a set of storage areas called registers,
      which the ALU directly acts upon. Additionally, the CPU maintains previously used instructions and data in an area
      known as a cache to increase the computer's performance.</li>
    <li>The CPU uses a memory address from the RAM for data tracking, referencing a certain location in the software and
      hardware. The CPU sends the information to the NIC. </li>
    <li>The <b><abbr title="Network Interface Controller">NIC</abbr></b> helps the computer communicate with the other
      computers in the network and connects it to the internet. The NIC port allows for electronic signals to be
      generated and received from the transceiver or Ethernet cable. </li>
    <img src="images/NIC.jpg" width=400 alt="Network card">
    <li>The controller in the NIC processes the received data and is a core part of the network adapter as it directly
      affects its performance. </li>
    <li>The bus interface serves as the connection between the NIC and the computer/server through expansion slots and
      transfers the information to the <b>router</b>.</li>
    <li>It directs and routes data between devices in a <abbr title="Local Area Network">LAN</abbr> and <abbr
        title="Wide Area Network">WAN</abbr>, acting as a gateway between networks. The router transfers data packets
      from the computer to the modem.</li>
    <img src="images/router.jpg" width=400 alt="router">
    <li>The <b>modem</b> connects your home devices to your <abbrv title="internet service provider">ISP</abbrv> by
      taking analog signals from your ISP and converting it into digital signals that can be understood by the local
      home devices and vice versa. Its name is an abbreviation of modulator (encoding information into a signal) and
      demodulator (extracting information from the signal), which describes its function. A modem has 2 plugs, one
      connecting to the ISP and another connecting to the <abbr title="Wireless Fidelity">WIFI</abbr> router.</li>
    <li>The modem will send the information to find the correct server, which would also be connected to the internet
      through a router. </li>
    <li>The data packet will reach the router at the application’s server and upload the picture of the item that the
      user is selling. </li>
