    <li>Online certification: There are many online biostatistics courses offered. <a
        href="https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=biostatistics">Coursera</a> and
      <a href="https://www.udemy.com/topic/biostatistics/">Udemy</a> offer a few programs and certification courses.
    </li>
    <li>Practical experience: Post-secondary students can also gain experience by working with a large database, managing spatially and temporally coded data or other data-related tasks.</li>
    <li>Volunteer opportunities: Students can obtain experiential learning by working with non-profit organizations, public health clinics, or other organizations to collect data that would be beneficial to them. Ex: <a href="https://www.globalbrigades.org/">Global Brigade</a></li>
    <li>Job experiences in public health services: You can also get internships or jobs as nurses, public health educators, epidemiology, or doctors before applying to become a biostatistician. It’s possible to gain experience by working as a researcher or clinical lab technician as well, or apply for a junior position as a biostatistician. </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Post-Secondary Programs</h2>
  <p>A graduate degree in mathematics, statistics or other related fields is required to be a biostatistician. Students take up a master’s program in science or public health and later go into a PhD program. </p>
